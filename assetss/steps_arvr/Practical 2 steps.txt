🔥 Problem Statement 2:
“Create a scene, where a candle is lit (with shadows and smoke), on mouse click using Unity.”

This task involves:

Making a candle object.

Adding a flame (particle system) and smoke.

Adding a point light to simulate illumination.

Enabling the flame/light/smoke on mouse click.

🧱 STEP 1: Set Up Your Basic Scene
Open a new or existing 3D Scene in Unity.

Add a Plane:

Right-click Hierarchy → 3D Object → Plane (ground)

Add a Candle (placeholder):

Use a Cylinder (Right-click → 3D Object → Cylinder) → Rename it to Candle

Resize it: Scale Y = 1.5, X/Z = 0.2

Optionally place a small sphere on top as wax wick

Create an Empty GameObject above the candle → name it CandleTop

💡 STEP 2: Add Flame and Light (Particle + Light)
🔥 Flame:
Right-click CandleTop → Effects → Particle System

Rename it to Flame

Adjust these settings for realistic candle flame:

Duration: 1, Looping: ✅

Start Lifetime: ~0.5

Start Speed: ~0.5

Start Size: ~0.3

Start Color: Yellow/Orange Gradient

Emission Rate: ~30

Shape: Cone → Angle = 10, Radius = 0.1

Disable "Play On Awake" (so it doesn’t start by default)

💨 Smoke:
Duplicate Flame → Rename it Smoke

Change its settings:

Start Color: Gray/Light Gray

Start Size: ~0.5

Start Speed: ~0.3

Start Lifetime: ~1.5

Use noise module for drifting effect

Lower emission rate (~10)

Disable "Play On Awake"

💡 Light Source:
Right-click CandleTop → Light → Point Light

Rename it to CandleLight

Set properties:

Intensity = 2

Range = 5

Color = Warm (orange/yellow)

Cast Shadows = ✅

Disable CandleLight by default (uncheck enabled)

💻 STEP 3: Scripting the Candle Lighting
Create a C# script → name it CandleToggle

Attach it to the Candle object or an empty GameObject

Open and write:

csharp
Copy
Edit
using UnityEngine;

public class CandleToggle : MonoBehaviour
{
    public ParticleSystem flame;
    public ParticleSystem smoke;
    public Light candleLight;

    private bool isLit = false;

    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0))
        {
            if (!isLit)
            {
                flame.Play();
                smoke.Play();
                candleLight.enabled = true;
            }
            else
            {
                flame.Stop();
                smoke.Stop();
                candleLight.enabled = false;
            }

            isLit = !isLit;
        }
    }
}
🧩 STEP 4: Assign References
Select the GameObject with the CandleToggle script.

In the Inspector, assign:

Flame → the flame particle system

Smoke → the smoke particle system

CandleLight → the point light

🧪 STEP 5: Test the Scene
Press Play in Unity.

Click the mouse — the candle should light up with flame, smoke, and warm light.

Click again — it should turn off.

🌟 Optional Enhancements
Use a realistic candle prefab from the Asset Store.

Add flickering to the light with a script.

Use animation or audio (e.g., spark sound when lit).

Add shadows on nearby objects for better visual impact.
