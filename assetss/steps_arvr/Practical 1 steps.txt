Great, Vedant! Here's a step-by-step guide to implement the AR/VR practical task:
“Turn a day scene into a night scene on mouse click in Unity.”

✅ OVERVIEW
You will:

Set up a basic scene with lighting and skybox (Day)

Create a "Night" version of lighting and skybox

Use C# script to switch between Day and Night on mouse click

🎮 STEP 1: Set Up Your Day Scene
Open Unity (3D project)

Add some objects to visualize the lighting:

Right-click in Hierarchy → 3D Object → Plane (as ground)

Add a Cube or Sphere for reference

Setup Directional Light (Sunlight):

Unity already has a "Directional Light" — rename it to Sun

Set:

Intensity = 1

Color = Light Yellow or White

Set Day Skybox:

Go to Window → Rendering → Lighting → Environment

Under Skybox Material, choose a bright sky (e.g., Skybox/Procedural or default)

🌃 STEP 2: Prepare Night Scene Elements
🔷 A. Create a Night Skybox:
Use Unity’s built-in Skybox/Procedural

Or download a Night Skybox from Asset Store

Create a new material:

Right-click in Project → Create → Material → Name it NightSky

Shader → Skybox → Procedural

Set Sun Size = 0, Atmosphere Thickness = ~1.2

Tint Color → Dark Blue

🔷 B. Duplicate Directional Light Settings for Night:
In script, you'll reduce Sun.intensity to a low value like 0.2

Optionally, you can change its color to deep blue

🧠 STEP 3: Create a Script to Toggle Day/Night
Create a script:

Right-click in Project → Create → C# Script → Name it DayNightToggle

Attach it to an empty GameObject in your scene (e.g., GameObject → "SceneController")

Edit the script:

csharp
Copy
Edit
using UnityEngine;

public class DayNightToggle : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Light sunLight; // Assign your directional light here
    public Material daySkybox;
    public Material nightSkybox;

    private bool isDay = true;

    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)) // Left mouse click
        {
            if (isDay)
            {
                // Switch to Night
                RenderSettings.skybox = nightSkybox;
                sunLight.intensity = 0.2f;
                sunLight.color = Color.blue;
            }
            else
            {
                // Switch to Day
                RenderSettings.skybox = daySkybox;
                sunLight.intensity = 1.0f;
                sunLight.color = Color.white;
            }

            isDay = !isDay;
        }
    }
}
🎛 STEP 4: Assign the References
Select SceneController GameObject

In the Inspector for DayNightToggle script:

Drag your Directional Light to Sun Light

Drag your Day Skybox material to Day Skybox

Drag your Night Skybox material to Night Skybox

🧪 STEP 5: Test the Scene
Press Play in Unity

Click anywhere in the game view

The scene should toggle between day and night

📌 OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS
Add stars or moon in night mode

Play sound effects during transition

Gradually transition lighting using Lerp for smoother change
