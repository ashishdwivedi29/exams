📚 Problem Statement 6:
“Create a 3D model of a reading table and props required on it, and set up lighting for the same using Unity.”

This task involves:

Creating or importing a reading table

Adding props (e.g., books, lamp, pen, notebook)

Setting up lighting for realistic appearance

🧱 STEP 1: Create the Scene
Open Unity → Create a new 3D Scene

Add a Plane (floor):

Hierarchy → Right-click → 3D Object → Plane → Rename it Floor

Scale it as needed (e.g., Scale = (3, 1, 3))

🪑 STEP 2: Create the Reading Table
🔨 Option A: Manual Table Creation (Using Primitives)
Table Top:

Right-click → 3D Object → Cube → Rename it TableTop

Scale: (2, 0.1, 1)

Position: (0, 1, 0)

Legs (4 Cubes):

Create one cube → Scale: (0.1, 1, 0.1)

Position it under the tabletop at each corner (adjust positions manually)

Duplicate the leg (Ctrl+D) three times to make all 4 legs

📦 STEP 3: Add Props
You can either:

Use Unity's built-in cubes and shapes to simulate props

Or import free models from Asset Store or Sketchfab

🔲 Use Primitives as Props (for practical simplicity)
Book: Cube (Scale = (0.5, 0.05, 0.4), color it dark red)

Notebook: Cube (Scale = (0.4, 0.03, 0.3), white or blue)

Pen: Cylinder (Scale = (0.05, 0.05, 0.5), rotate and place diagonally)

Lamp: Use:

Cylinder for stand

Sphere or cone for lamp head (rotate downward)

📦 Tip: Group the lamp using an empty GameObject as parent → makes positioning easier.

💡 STEP 4: Set Up Lighting
1. Add Light Source
Hierarchy → Right-click → Light → Point Light or Spot Light

Position it just above the lamp

Adjust:

Range = 3–5

Intensity = 2–5

Color = soft yellow

2. Enable Shadows
Select the light

Check Shadows → Soft Shadows

Adjust Shadow Strength to 0.5–0.8

3. Global Light (optional)
Keep or adjust Directional Light to simulate daylight, but reduce intensity if you're going for a night/indoor look

🎨 STEP 5: Add Materials
Apply colors or textures:

Create Materials (Right-click in Project → Create → Material)

Apply colors/textures to table, books, lamp, etc.

Optional:

Use Unity's URP/Lit shader for better material control (metallic, smoothness, etc.)

🧪 STEP 6: Test and Polish
Play the scene

Navigate with Scene camera to review lighting

Move camera to get a nice top-down or side perspective
