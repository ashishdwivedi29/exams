🎭 Problem Statement 3:
“Change a character's emotion (Neutral → Happy → Sad → Angry, etc.) using Unity.”

This involves:

A 3D character (model or placeholder)

Multiple facial expressions (via textures, materials, blend shapes, or swapping objects)

A script to switch emotions on mouse click

🧱 STEP 1: Set Up the Scene
Open Unity → Create a new 3D Scene or use an existing one.

Add a character:

Option 1: Use a simple 3D face model or cube as a placeholder

Option 2: Use a free 3D character from Unity Asset Store (like Unity-Chan, Mixamo, or ReadyPlayerMe)

Position the camera to focus on the face.

🎨 STEP 2: Prepare Emotions
Option A: Using Textures (Easy for Practical Exam)
Create 4 different materials or textures representing:

Neutral face

Happy face (smile)

Sad face (tears, frown)

Angry face (red tone, angry brows)

How:
Create 4 materials: NeutralMat, HappyMat, SadMat, AngryMat

Assign different textures/images to each

Apply them to the same 3D face

📁 (You can create basic faces using MS Paint, GIMP, or Photoshop if needed)

Option B: Blend Shapes (Advanced)
If using a 3D model with blend shapes (like from Blender or Mixamo):

Create blend shapes for smile, frown, brows down, etc.

Use script to adjust blend shape weights on click

💻 STEP 3: Script to Change Emotions
Create a new C# script → EmotionSwitcher.cs

Attach it to the character GameObject

Code:

csharp
Copy
Edit
using UnityEngine;

public class EmotionSwitcher : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Material neutralMat;
    public Material happyMat;
    public Material sadMat;
    public Material angryMat;

    private Renderer rend;
    private int state = 0;

    void Start()
    {
        rend = GetComponent<Renderer>();
        rend.material = neutralMat;
    }

    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0))
        {
            state = (state + 1) % 4;

            switch (state)
            {
                case 0:
                    rend.material = neutralMat;
                    break;
                case 1:
                    rend.material = happyMat;
                    break;
                case 2:
                    rend.material = sadMat;
                    break;
                case 3:
                    rend.material = angryMat;
                    break;
            }
        }
    }
}
🧩 STEP 4: Assign Materials
Select the character in the scene

In the Inspector:

Assign NeutralMat, HappyMat, SadMat, and AngryMat to the script fields

🧪 STEP 5: Test It
Press Play

Click the mouse → character’s face/emotion cycles between:

Neutral → Happy → Sad → Angry → Neutral...
